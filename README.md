# Tft AI
Helper tool for the auto-chess game called Teamfight Tactics


It calculates the best build/comp for you, given what you have and what others build

Disclaimer: 
You can be in top 4 in ~55% of the games and 1st in 25.6% by only building 1 comp
so technically you dont need to predict anything  
comp is redeemed knights/rangers btw  

Current prediction algorithm only factors in your champions and items and decides which comp you should play. Currently is under testing but is showing promising results

Current interface is temporary and will be replaced with image recognition AI that gets data from live game
