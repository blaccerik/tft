# Tft AI
Helper tool for the auto-chess game called Teamfight Tactics

It collects data from the game using yolov3 image recognition algorithm and calculates the best build/comp for you

Disclaimer!  
* Current version of yolo3 can only find champions and not items
* Current prediction algorithm only factors in your champions and /items. Since set 5.5 was recently released I dont have enough data to train nn which factors in other players builds, but it shouldn't make that big of a diffrence
