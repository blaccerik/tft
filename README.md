# tft
Helper tool for the auto-chess game called Teamfight Tactics


It calculates the best build/comp for you, given what other players build  

Disclaimer: 
after analysing the data its clear that you dont need to predict anything and you can win 25.6% of the games 
and finish in top4 in ~55% of the games by building only 1 comp 
so technically you dont need to predict anything 
comp is redeemed knights/rangers btw 

But if you do need that 1st place then by predicting you cna win 26.8% of the games 
(as you can see not much difference but atleast is something)
