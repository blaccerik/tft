# Tft AI
Helper tool for the auto-chess game called Teamfight Tactics


It calculates the best build/comp for you, given what you have and what others build

Disclaimer: 
You can be in top 4 in ~55% of the games and 1st in 25.6% by only building 1 comp
so technically you dont need to predict anything  
comp is redeemed knights/rangers btw  

But if you do need that 1st place then by predicting you can win 26.8% of the games   
As you can see not much difference but atleast is something   
But to be fair this was calculated using only champions and not items

Current interface only supports your champions and items and you have to enter them manually, but this is temporary as I am currently working on image recognition to get data from live game
