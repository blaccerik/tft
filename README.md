# Tft AI
Helper tool for the auto-chess game called Teamfight Tactics

It collects data from the game using yolov3 image recognition algorithm and calculates the best build/comp for you

Current prediction algorithm only factors in your champions and items and decides which comp you should play. Since 5.5 was released recently I dont have enough data do train neural network which factors in other players build, but it shouldnt make that big of a diffrence
